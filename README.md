# Vimcord
Vimcord is a Vencord plugin that attempts to bring Vim(ium)-style navigation to Discord. You can scroll with ```jk```, scroll *even faster* with ```ud```, move between servers and channels and pings with ease, even through gifs and emojis, all without ever moving your hands from your keyboard.

## The Problem
You are typing vigorously. Coding even. Your hands haven't moved away from your keyboard for 20 minutes straight. You get a Discord ping. You alt tab to Discord. <br>
You now have to **move* your hand to your mouse. You open the ping. <br>
You **move** your hand once again to your keyboard to type out a message. <br>
You, **once again**, **move** your hand to your mouse to scroll and check out other messages. You decide to reply to another message. <br>
You move your mouse towards the reply button. Oh, what now? Another message arrived and the button moved? You don't know what you pressed but it sure as hell wasn't the reply button? Oh joy. <br>
You notice a typo in your message. You move the mouse towards the edit button. And what the hell another message arrived and everything moved once again? <br>
You cut your loses and decide to go check messages in another server. You are 646 messages behind the current ones and the chat is still going. You decide to check out what everyone is typing right now. You click the **Mark As Read** button. It does nothing. You click it again. It does nothing. No movement no nothing. You click it again. Nothing. you start getting a bit ticked off. <br>
You skim over the messages on your screen and want to check out a reply. You click on the reply. You get shot down to the current messages with your reply nowhere in sight. <br>
You start to cry.
